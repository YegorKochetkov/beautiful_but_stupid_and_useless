# Beautiful, but stupid and useless site

In progress...

The success of the project in a useful and functional product (service), and does not depend on its beauty.

Such websites are liked by customers, needed by marketers and managers to justify their salaries, but not needed by clients.

Clients need functionality and convenience, not animation.

MacBook sells well because it is convenient and functional, not because the website has beautiful animation.

Moreover, amidst all these "beauties," everyone forgets about users with disabilities. It's better to spend these efforts on improving accessibility (this project does not account for users with disabilities - this requires effort for which I will not be paid)."

# General Code Style & Formatting

- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx).
- Prefer named exports for components.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes and OOP approach.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

# Styling & UI

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use [GSAP](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/)
